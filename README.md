Dad joke project

Dad Joke Code Challenge
```
Challenge: Write an Android App (or as close as you can get in 45 minutes)
Please read all of the requirements before proceeding. This purpose of this exercise is to show how you would set up a new project that you expected to scale. We think dad jokes are going to be hugely popular and want this app to be flexible, scalable, and maintainable for when we add new joke sources or change how we want the jokes to be displayed.
- You must share your screen.
- You must use Android Studio
- We will ask you to submit your work when time is complete.
- Please plan to complete your work in 45 minutes.
- Please consult any reference other than another person.
- Please complete the MVP before implementing any stretch goals. - You may use any library, but be prepared to explain your choices.
  Use https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api as your data source.
- MVP: Create a single activity application that uses the above api resource to get random jokes as json responses, and then display those jokes using a recycler view.
- Stretch: Add a search feature to display jokes matching the search term.
- Stretch: Implement database storage of all jokes received for offline viewing and
  have the view indicate if the returned jokes are new or already exist.
- Stretch: Make the jokes expandable with like and save buttons. Do not connect logic to these, just show how you would handle the related data.
- Stretch: Style and add a splash screen.
